# yeti-edit 

Edit yaml files generated by the [yeti](https://github.com/WarpspeedSCP/yet-cc-rs) tool for Cross Channel final desktop edition easily.

This extension doesn't support inserting new opcodes, you'll have to do that manually. 

Just install the extension, and you'll be able to open any yeti yaml files with a gui.
